Short description in En:
You will have to learn how to model the churn of customers of a telecom company. This task is very important in practice and algorithms for its solution are used in real telecom companies, because if we know that a client is going to leave us, we will try to retain him by offering some bonuses. On the data page, you can upload two files - train.csv (contains feature columns and the target variable) and test.csv (contains only feature columns). As an answer, you need to upload predictions of customer churn probabilities for test.csv. An example of a file with predictions is submission.csv.
